        Model: LGBMClassifier

        This report compares a model trained on real data (baseline) against a
        model trained on synthetic data. Both are tested on a held-out set
        of real data.

        Baseline (Train on Real, Test on Real):
        - Accuracy:  1.0000
        - F1-Score:  1.0000

        TSTR (Train on Synthetic, Test on Real):
        - Accuracy:  0.9999
        - F1-Score:  0.9999
