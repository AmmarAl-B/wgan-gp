    ============================================================
    Model: Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detector)

    1. The model was trained ONLY on the synthetic data.
    2. The model was then tested on the REAL benign data.

    Result:
    -------
    - Accuracy: 97.31% of the REAL samples were correctly identified as 'normal' by the model.

    Interpretation:
    - A high accuracy (>90-95%) suggests that the synthetic data is a good substitute for the real data,
      as the model learned the underlying patterns of normal behavior from it.
    - A low accuracy suggests the synthetic data's distribution is significantly different from the real data.
